# BIke-Sales
This project is based off of an Excel guided project presented by Mr. Alex Freberg on his YouTube channel, Alex The Analyst. This project features data cleaning and conditional formatting of raw data related to bike sales before pivot tables, charts, and a dashboard of some findings had been generated.
